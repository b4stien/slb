## Configuration

The config is done in a file named `visualisatorConfig.json`, which has
to be in the root directory, next to index.html.

Four settings are expected in this file, described in
visualisatorConfig.sample.json. Be careful, as comments are forbidden in
JSON syntax, this config file is not valid.

All the pathes in this directory are relative to the root directory (ie
where index.html lives).

Test colours can be customized in `css/visualisator.css`. A test with
the status `RandomStatus` will have the class `test-randomstatus`.

## Utilisation

Once the config is done, simply open `index.html`.
